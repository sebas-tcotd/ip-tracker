## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### What I learned

In this project, I have proposed to use a Clean Architecture approach. I have learned the basic concepts to create an application using this architecture, separating it under the respective layers.
Despite being a small project for this type of architectures, since it is my first approach to this type of design, I think it has been, at least, a good start.

### Continued development

I would like to reinforce my Clean Architecture concepts to better apply them in future projects I create. What I found a bit difficult -at least at first- was trying to implement the Repository pattern correctly. Also, how the layers are connected to each other.
